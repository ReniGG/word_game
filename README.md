# word_game

This is a simple word guessing game I created to practice Python programming and OOP principles. In this project, I focused on:

  - Designing and using classes to represent different entities (e.g., Letter, Bot, Game).
  - Encapsulating game logic within methods that interact with the class attributes.
  - Using lists and strings to manage the word list and guesses.
  - Handling file reading and using the random module for generating random choices.

The game features a bot that guesses letters from a word list, with feedback given after each guess about which letters are correct or incorrect.

This project is based on the Python 3 Programming Specialization course by Michigan University, with my own implementation and logic, though it currently features a simpler implementation with fewer functionalities than the original.
